# go-check-http-methods

A powerful, fast, and lightweight Go tool for testing HTTP method security across web applications and servers. Detect HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities, dangerous methods, and server misconfigurations with ease.

## üöÄ Features

- üî• **Comprehensive Method Testing** - Tests a wide range of HTTP methods including standard and non-standard methods
- üîç **Vulnerability Detection** - Identifies potential HTTP verb tampering vulnerabilities and dangerous method configurations
- üåç **Multiple URL Support** - Test individual URLs or bulk test from a file
- üìä **Flexible Output Formats** - Results in plain text, JSON, or XML format
- üîí **Custom Authentication** - Support for basic auth, custom headers, and cookies
- üö¶ **Concurrent Testing** - Configurable concurrency for faster scanning
- üé® **Colorized Output** - Easy-to-read color-coded results (with no-color option)
- üîÑ **Proxy Support** - Route requests through a proxy for anonymity or testing internal networks
- üì± **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (both amd64 and arm64)

## üì• Installation

### Pre-compiled Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Khurana/go-check-http-methods/releases).

### From Source

Make sure you have Go 1.23+ installed, then run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abhinandan-Khurana/go-check-http-methods.git
cd go-check-http-methods

# Build for your platform
make install

# Or build for all platforms
make all
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/Abhinandan-Khurana/go-check-http-methods@latest
```

## üìö Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Test a single URL

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com>

# Test URLs from a file

go-check-http-methods -f urls.txt

# Output results in JSON format

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -format json

# Save results to a file

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -o results.txt
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Test with custom HTTP methods

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -m methods.txt

# Increase concurrency for faster scanning

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -c 20

# Use silent mode (no banner, only results)

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -silent

# Disable color output

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -nc

# Add custom headers and authentication

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -H "Authorization: Bearer token" -H "X-Custom: Value"

# Use a proxy

go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -proxy <http://127.0.0.1:8080>
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
-u string
Single URL to test
-f string
File containing URLs to test (one per line)
-o string
Output file for results
-format string
Output format: txt, json, or xml (default "txt")
-m string
File containing HTTP methods to test
-c int
Number of concurrent requests (default 10)
-t int
Request timeout in seconds (default 10)
-L Follow redirects
-k Allow insecure TLS connections
-v Verbose output
-q Quiet mode, no output except results
-silent
Silent mode, no banner but show results
-nc No color output
-view string
View mode: all, enabled, vulnerable (default "all")
-proxy string
Use proxy (format: <http://host:port>)
-ua string
User agent string
-H string
Custom header (can be used multiple times, format: 'Name: Value')
-cookie string
Cookie to include (can be used multiple times, format: 'name=value')
-auth string
Basic authentication (format: username:password)
```

## üîç Examples

### Testing for Verb Tampering Vulnerabilities

```bash
go-check-http-methods -u <https://example.com> -view vulnerable -v
```

This command will:

- Test the URL with all supported HTTP methods
- Show only vulnerable methods in the results
- Display verbose output during scanning

### Sample Output

```bash

```
